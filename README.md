# Advanced Building Blocks - Bubble Sort

> In this project, I've implemented the bubble sort algorithm, the project was built putting the focus on the use of yield and passing a block to a method.

This project is created to improve the skills using Ruby, for this reason, you can use this code to see how Ruby works and to check out if you can implement this code for one of your Ruby projects.

**The first function "bubble_sort()" is used to sort an INT array**

The input for the first fuction is
<pre>
array_trial_int = [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
</pre>

The output for the first fuction is
<pre>
> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
</pre>

**The second function "bubble_sort_by()" is used to sort an STR array**

The input for the second fuction is
<pre>
array_trial_str = %w[hi hello hey]
</pre>

The output for the second fuction is
<pre>
> ["hi", "hey", "hello"]
</pre>

As you can see in both results, the input arrays were converted to a new array, but those are sorted now.

## Built With 🔨

- Ruby
- Visual Studio Code
- Git & Github

### Install

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.
- Open terminal
- Clone this project by command git clone https://github.com/DanteAlonsoHT/bubble_sort_ruby.git
- Cd bubble_sort_ruby folder
- Run bubble_sort.rb with Ruby in your terminal

## Getting Started 

- In bubble_sort.rb file is the main to run the two functions to sort arrays.
- I've included linters to improve and cleaning the Ruby code.

### Prerequisites

- IDE to edit and run the code (I used Visual Studio Code 🔥).

### Usage

- For anyone who wants to practice Ruby.
- How to apply yield in Ruby.
